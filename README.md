# Graph data structure to represent a network

The program allows the user to open a map (a background image), define locations on the map with mouse clicks, create connections between these locations, and then find a path between two user-selected locations.

The program uses a graph data structure to represent the network of locations and connections between them. It assumes that the locations have a small number of connections to other locations, and uses adjacency lists for efficient representation. The program includes a class ListGraph and a class Edge for the representation of simple weighted undirected graphs implemented by adjacency lists. These classes are written generically so that they can be used by other applications as well.
